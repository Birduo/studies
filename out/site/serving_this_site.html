Serving This Site</h1>
<p>
... I&#39;m back.</p>
<p>
This website was made a while ago with the help of <a href="https://github.com/Birduo/hgen">hgen</a>, my haskell-based static site generator.
But that only generates the site, it doesn&#39;t serve it. So, I wrote a simple server to host the site.</p>
<p>
However, running the server became problematic between moving, where it would be run, and how I would even get a public IP to run it on. 
Thankfully, this problem is solved by a raspberry pi! Using reverse tunneling, I can run the server from my home, and have it served from the raspberry pi.</p>
<p>
Now, adding files like this one becomes as easy as a &quot;make&quot; and &quot;git push&quot; before pulling it on the server for the rest of you to see!
It&#39;s a bit more motivating to write when there&#39;s something to write on, so hopefully I will continue to add to this site after that &quot;small&quot; (a couple years?) hiatus.</p>
<p>
I have a lot of ideas for this site, and I&#39;m sure I will add more to it over time.
For Quantum Computing, I&#39;m thinking of adding discussion on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
QML (Quantum Machine Learning)  </li>
  <li>
Google&#39;s Sycamore Chip  </li>
</ul>
<p>
And potentially more on language learning, as learning Mandarin has taught me quite a bit about both the structure of languages as well as how to effectively learn and acquire them.</p>
