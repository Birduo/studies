<h1>Keitais</h1>
<br>I bought a japanese flip phone, or keitai, a few months ago. <br>It's a Kyocera 902kc, and although neglecting to use it in the past, I now believe I've understood the perspective and use case of it.<br><br>Most people who discuss keitais come from r/dumbphones, and the reasons become clear after figuring out the limitations of the phone.<br><ul>
<li>No Google Play Services, so many apps won't work</li>
<li>Sideloading apps must be done initially (to get a store setup)</li>
<li>Poor cell signal depening on location</li>
<li>No touchscreen - instead, you have to use a cursor to navigate with arrow keys</li>
<li>Somewhat poor battery life</li>
<li>Android 8.1 (an older version) is the latest version of Android that the phone supports</li>
<li>Poor camera quality (8 MP)</li>
</ul>
<br>Now, many of these can be quoted as "limitations" when imagining using the phone as you would a smartphone.<br>However, I believe that an alternative perspective to the limitations is what r/dumphones users are taking. <br>The phone is <b>meant</b> to reduce screentime, and simplifying the experience with a phone like this begins to make more and more sense. <br>Increasing friction to do more complex tasks like opening TikTok or a browser is intentionally difficult to them.<br><br>With that in mind, here's some of the quirks and things that I appreciate and intend to use:<br>- <b>Tiled home screen</b> - Using the arrow keys is much easier with the native home screen in a 3x4 grid.<br>- <b>Status screen</b> - There is a status screen on the back of the phone, useful for notifications and small checks.<br>- <b>Reading</b> - My apps are mostly synced to my phone, so I can read what I want easily. If not on this phone, then I still have a small Boox tablet with an e-ink screen, which I use for reading.<br>- <b>To do list</b> - I use Microsoft To Do, which can still sync to this phone.<br>- <b>Key Mapper</b> - Creating custom key bindings on a phone is actually pretty fun to get creative with.<br>- <b>Camera</b> - I do appreciate the lack of quality from time to time for aesthetic reasons.<br><br>I haven't used the phone much, especially since it doesn't have its SIM card activated at the moment, but I'm sure I will use it more in the future (and because I wrote this).<br><br><br><h3>Navigation</h3>
