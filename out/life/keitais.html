Keitais</h1>
<p>
I bought a japanese flip phone, or keitai, a few months ago. 
It&#39;s a Kyocera 902kc, and although neglecting to use it in the past, I now believe I&#39;ve understood the perspective and use case of it.</p>
<p>
Most people who discuss keitais come from r/dumbphones, and the reasons become clear after figuring out the limitations of the phone.</p>
<ul>
  <li>
No Google Play Services, so many apps won&#39;t work  </li>
  <li>
Sideloading apps must be done initially (to get a store setup)  </li>
  <li>
Poor cell signal depening on location  </li>
  <li>
No touchscreen - instead, you have to use a cursor to navigate with arrow keys  </li>
  <li>
Somewhat poor battery life  </li>
  <li>
Android 8.1 (an older version) is the latest version of Android that the phone supports  </li>
  <li>
Poor camera quality (8 MP)  </li>
</ul>
<p>
Now, many of these can be quoted as &quot;limitations&quot; when imagining using the phone as you would a smartphone.
However, I believe that an alternative perspective to the limitations is what r/dumbphones users are taking. 
The phone is <strong>meant</strong> to reduce screentime, and simplifying the experience with a phone like this begins to make more and more sense. 
Increasing friction to do more complex tasks like opening TikTok or a browser is intentionally difficult to them.</p>
<p>
With that in mind, here&#39;s some of the quirks and things that I appreciate and intend to use:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
<strong>Tiled home screen</strong> - Using the arrow keys is much easier with the native home screen in a 3x4 grid.  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Status screen</strong> - There is a status screen on the back of the phone, useful for notifications and small checks.  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Reading</strong> - My apps are mostly synced to my phone, so I can read what I want easily. If not on this phone, then I still have a small Boox tablet with an e-ink screen, which I use for reading.  </li>
  <li>
<strong>To do list</strong> - I use Microsoft To Do, which can still sync to this phone.  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Key Mapper</strong> - Creating custom key bindings on a phone is actually pretty fun to get creative with.  </li>
  <li>
<strong>Camera</strong> - I do appreciate the lack of quality from time to time for aesthetic reasons.  </li>
</ul>
<p>
I haven&#39;t used the phone much, especially since it doesn&#39;t have its SIM card activated at the moment, but I&#39;m sure I will use it more in the future (and because I wrote this).</p>
