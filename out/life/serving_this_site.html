<h1>Serving This Site </h1>
<br>... I'm back.<br><br><br>This website was made a while ago with the help of <a href="https://github.com/Birduo/hgen">hgen</a>, my haskell-based static site generator.<br>But that only generates the site, it doesn't serve it. So, I wrote a simple server to host the site.<br><br>However, running the server became problematic between moving, where it would be run, and how I would even get a public IP to run it on. <br>Thankfully, this problem is solved by a raspberry pi! Using reverse tunneling, I can run the server from my home, and have it served from the raspberry pi.<br><br>Now, adding files like this one becomes as easy as a "make" and "git push" before pulling it on the server for the rest of you to see!<br>It's a bit more motivating to write when there's something to write on, so hopefully I will continue to add to this site after that "small" (a couple years?) hiatus.<br><br><br>I have a lot of ideas for this site, and I'm sure I will add more to it over time.<br>For Quantum Computing, I'm thinking of adding discussion on:<br><ul>
<li>QML (Quantum Machine Learning)</li>
<li>Google's Sycamore Chip</li>
</ul>
<br>And potentially more on language learning, as learning Mandarin has taught me quite a bit about both the structure of languages as well as how to effectively learn and acquire them.<br><br><h3>Navigation</h3>
