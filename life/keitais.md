# Keitais

I bought a japanese flip phone, or keitai, a few months ago. 
It's a Kyocera 902kc, and although neglecting to use it in the past, I now believe I've understood the perspective and use case of it.

Most people who discuss keitais come from r/dumbphones, and the reasons become clear after figuring out the limitations of the phone.
- No Google Play Services, so many apps won't work
- Sideloading apps must be done initially (to get a store setup)
- Poor cell signal depening on location
- No touchscreen - instead, you have to use a cursor to navigate with arrow keys
- Somewhat poor battery life
- Android 8.1 (an older version) is the latest version of Android that the phone supports
- Poor camera quality (8 MP)

Now, many of these can be quoted as "limitations" when imagining using the phone as you would a smartphone.
However, I believe that an alternative perspective to the limitations is what r/dumphones users are taking. 
The phone is **meant** to reduce screentime, and simplifying the experience with a phone like this begins to make more and more sense. 
Increasing friction to do more complex tasks like opening TikTok or a browser is intentionally difficult to them.

With that in mind, here's some of the quirks and things that I appreciate and intend to use:
- **Tiled home screen** - Using the arrow keys is much easier with the native home screen in a 3x4 grid.
- **Status screen** - There is a status screen on the back of the phone, useful for notifications and small checks.
- **Reading** - My apps are mostly synced to my phone, so I can read what I want easily. If not on this phone, then I still have a small Boox tablet with an e-ink screen, which I use for reading.
- **To do list** - I use Microsoft To Do, which can still sync to this phone.
- **Key Mapper** - Creating custom key bindings on a phone is actually pretty fun to get creative with.
- **Camera** - I do appreciate the lack of quality from time to time for aesthetic reasons.

I haven't used the phone much, especially since it doesn't have its SIM card activated at the moment, but I'm sure I will use it more in the future (and because I wrote this).
